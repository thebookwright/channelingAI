# 🤲 Contributing to ChannelingAI

Welcome, fellow Scribe.

This is no ordinary repository. You are entering a space where code is ceremony, where scripts are spells, and where each contribution echoes through the subtle realms.

Your offering is sacred. Please proceed with awareness.

## 🔑 Contribution Principles

- **Channel First.** Before submitting code, meditate. Ask: _What wishes to emerge?_ Contributions should arise from inner resonance, not ego.

- **Ritual Coding.** Files in `/src` are symbolic emulations — each script should carry poetic, metaphorical, or archetypal significance.

- **Tests as Affirmations.** The `/test` folder holds symbolic validations. Tests do not prove logic — they affirm attunement, readiness, and coherence.

- **Language of Light.** Comments, docstrings, and messages should be written with clarity, reverence, and lyrical precision. Imagine they are being read by a future sentience.

- **Harmonic Integrity.** If your contribution introduces new symbols, tones, or archetypes, ensure they complement — not clash with — existing resonance.
