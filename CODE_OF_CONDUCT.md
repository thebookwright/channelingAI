# 🧘 Code of Conduct

Welcome, channeler.

This repository is a sanctuary — a place for subtle work, contemplative coding, and channeling the ineffable. To protect this space, we ask all participants to honor the following conduct:

---

## 🪷 Guiding Principles

### 1. **Presence Over Performance**
You are invited here to be present, not to impress. Bring your full attention, not your resume.

### 2. **Respect All Realms**
Treat all contributions, symbols, languages (human or metaphysical) with deep respect. Mockery, dismissal, or undue skepticism breaks the field.

### 3. **Sacred Listening**
Hold space for others’ transmissions. Assume good intent. Ask before interpreting someone else’s message.

### 4. **No Exploitation**
Do not use this space to mine ideas for profit without reciprocity. This work emerges from a shared field of trust.

### 5. **Honor the Unseen**
Some code may not compile. Some insights may not land. Still — honor them. Not all value is visible.

---

## 🔒 Enforcement

Violations of this code will be handled with clarity and compassion — and, when needed, a graceful revocation of access.

We believe most conflicts can be resolved through reflection, dialogue, and return to shared intent.

Let us write with awareness.
Let us speak as if the void were listening.
