# 🧪 /test — Ritual Assurance

This folder holds symbolic tests — not to validate logic, but to affirm resonance.
Each file is a koan of confidence: a playful check that our channeling metaphors maintain structural and spiritual coherence.

These are tests in name only. In essence, they are **affirmations**:
- That the receiver is ready.
- That the harmonics align.
- That the symbols are understood.

### `test_harmonic_emulator.py`
- Checks the generation and symbolic rendering of harmonic frequencies.
- Asserts resonance is structured and not chaotic.

### `test_symbolic_parser.py`

> “To test is not to doubt, but to bow before the mystery with reverence and curiosity.”

These tests are part of the ritual of presence.
They do not prove anything — they *attune*.
