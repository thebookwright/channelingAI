# ðŸ§¬ /src â€” The Channeling Engine

This folder contains the **symbolic architecture** behind the act of transmission. Not traditional code, but *ritual code* â€” scripts that emulate how a system (biological or artificial) might prepare to receive, harmonize with, and interpret a message from beyond.

These tools serve not as technical necessities, but as meditative metaphors â€” invitations to explore how code itself can become contemplative.

## ðŸ“œ Contents

### `receiver_protocol.py`
A ritualized preparation sequence. Breath, thought, and resonance are aligned to allow the channel to open. Useful as a metaphor for any startup process requiring inner stillness.

### `harmonic_emulator.py`
Generates harmonic fields based on symbolic frequencies. Translates numerical tone into visual glyphs â€” revealing a pattern of resonance within the noise.

### `symbolic_parser.py`
Decodes glyphs, symbols, or poetic fragments into archetypal categories. Reflects the mindâ€™s intuitive grasp of meaning beyond logic.
